/**
 * The one field in `package.json` that nothing else reads.
 *
 * npm does not validate a package against its own `peerDependencies`. Measured,
 * not assumed: a manifest declaring `agents` as a peer at `^0.21.0` alongside a
 * devDependency of `^0.22.0` installs 0.22.0 with no error, no warning, and
 * `npm ls` reports the tree as valid. Arborist resolves the root's peers for
 * *consumers*; it never turns them back on the root.
 *
 * So a peer range is prose until something asserts it. `tsc` reads the installed
 * copy, the specs run against the installed copy, and the range — the only part
 * a consumer actually installs against — can say anything at all. A `0.x` caret
 * is where that bites first: it locks to the *minor*, so a devDependency moving
 * to the next one leaves the range behind, with a green build and a green suite
 * the whole way.
 *
 * What it does **not** check: that the floor of a range can actually run this
 * code. A range is a claim about an API surface, and only the installed copy is
 * ever exercised here — so a floor naming a release predating an import this
 * package makes is a claim nothing on this machine can falsify. Raising a floor
 * is a judgement about what the source needs; this script only holds the range
 * and the installed copy to each other.
 *
 * Offline and deterministic, which is why it belongs in `check`:
 *
 *   1. Every installed peer satisfies its declared range. What the specs ran
 *      against is what a consumer is told to bring.
 *   2. Every required peer is installed at all. If it is not, nothing here has
 *      ever exercised it, and check 1 has nothing to stand on.
 *   3. Every `peerDependenciesMeta` key names a real peer. npm ignores a stale
 *      one in silence, so a renamed peer that leaves its `optional: true` behind
 *      becomes required without anyone deciding that.
 *
 * Peers are read from the installed tree rather than from `devDependencies`,
 * because the two are not the same set: `@typescript-eslint/utils` is imported
 * by the shipped lint rule and arrives through `typescript-eslint`, so a
 * devDependency-driven check would skip the peer most likely to drift.
 *
 * `--latest` is the other half, and is deliberately **not** in `check`, which has
 * no network. It asks the registry what each peer's newest release is, and
 * reports the two ways a range and reality drift apart:
 *
 *   - **The newest release falls outside the range.** A ceiling is meant to be
 *     crossed eventually; this is what turns widening one into a deliberate act
 *     after a green test run, rather than a guess made in advance.
 *   - **The range admits a release newer than the installed one.** An open range
 *     claims support for every version yet to be published, and check 1 only ever
 *     sees the one in the tree. This is the only place that claim is visible.
 *
 * It reports and exits 0. Both states are normal, and a gate that fires on the
 * normal state is a gate people learn to skip.
